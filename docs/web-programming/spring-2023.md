For questions about homework, course content, installation, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is:
Post the question in blackboard/group chat and hopefully your peers will answer. Note that in blackboard questions are visible to everyone.
For private matters send an email to helpline: udin [at] sju [dot] ac [dot] kr.

## Course Policies

### Collaboration policy

We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students (and on blackboard), but you are not allowed to look at any other students assignment or code outside of your pair. Discussion is encouraged, copying is not allowed.

### Late day policy

Homework is due before each class. Late submission are not allowed.

### Communication to students

Class announcements will be through blackboard. All homework and quizzes will be posted in blackboard. Also all feedback forms. Important note: make sure you have your settings set so you can receive emails from blackboard.

### Academic honesty

We give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.
